"""
BluePilot: Ford CAN-FD path-angle–primary lateral control (developer).

Steering intent is c1 from κ → θ. Converts planner/model curvature into ``path_angle`` using
PSCM short lookahead d_ref and y ≈ ½κ x² ⇒ path_angle = ½ κ d_ref (see
``bluepilot/agent_info/20_FORD_PSCM_KNOWLEDGE_PACK.md``). Predicted curvature (modelV2) is
blended with ``actuators.curvature`` per ``FordPathAngleBlendRatio`` (0 = planner only,
1 = model only).

**c0 (path_offset) is always zero on the wire.** Lane centering is delivered as a small,
clipped additive trim onto path_angle, mirroring ``lateral_curv_ext`` (which also zeros c0 to
avoid the c0/c1 sign-conflict failure mode). The trim is built from model y at
``path_offset_lookup_time`` blended with laneline center, fed through the curv-mode
``LC_PID_controller``, speed-gated, ROC-limited, and hard-clipped to ``FordPathAngleTrimMax``
(rad, default 0.3) so it can never dominate the κ-derived command. Toggled by the
``FordPrefAnglePathOffsetEnable`` param (UI label TBD-renamed in a follow-up cleanup).
