BluePilot: shared manual-steering-override ("human turn") detection for Ford lateral control.

Both Ford lateral strategies hand control back to the driver on a sustained manual turn, and the
detection is identical, so it lives here as one class instead of being copied into each mode. What
each mode DOES with the signal differs: curvature-primary (``lateral_curv_ext``) zeroes its command
(reset_steering + post-reset ramp); angle-primary (``lateral_angle_ext``) forces lateral inactive
(mode 0 on the wire) and ramps path_angle back in from zero through its soft ROC on release.
